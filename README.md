# Module-2-Challenge

## Description

For this Module 2 Challenge, the challege was to build a portfolio web application from scratch. We are building our initial portfolio that we can update and add to as our projects develop over the time of the course. This portfolio is necessary for once we graduate from this course, we can use this portfolio to display our skills and work to potential employers. Portfolios are a good way to organize all of your work in a single source that can be supplement to your resume when you are in the job search/interviewing process. This project used elements of HTML to build the weboage and the added on CSS to add styling, animations, and responsiveness to the webpage. It helped be develop my HTML and CSS skills with a focus on using flex boxes so that the layout can be how I would like it to be. I learned a lot from creating this portfolio and looking forward to adding more!
