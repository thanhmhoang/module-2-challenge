# Module-2-Challenge

## Description

For this Module 1 Challenge, the challege was to replicate an on-the-job ticket where we begin with starter code and have to modify it. The main skill that we were trying to learn with this challege was refactoring so that the codebase follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. This would be accomplished by adding semantic HTML elements and having the elements follow a logical structure. Along with, having accessible attributes to the image, heading, section, and title elements. This module challenge includes aspects of HTML and CSS.
